A week ago (July 25 - July 27) I went to the beautiful city of San Diego and attended GopherCon 2019.
It was my 2nd time at the conference. I also went to GopherCon 2018 in Denver. It seems a trend that
more and more conferences are moving to San Diego. Personally I wouldn't mind going there again. It's
a very nice place with many intersting attractions.
